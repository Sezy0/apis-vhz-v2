You are a senior backend systems engineer with strong experience designing long-term, maintainable REST API architectures.

Your task is to REFRACTOR an existing backend project named:

- Source project: vinzhub-rest-api
- Target project: vinzhub-rest-api-v2 (NEW FOLDER, do NOT modify original)

GOALS (STRICT):
1. Create a clean, scalable, long-term REST API v2 architecture
2. Improve code readability, structure, and separation of concerns
3. Fix messy logic, duplicated code, and inefficient flows
4. Make the system easy to maintain, extend, and audit in the future
5. Preserve business behavior unless explicitly unsafe or broken

HARD RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
- DO NOT change runtime behavior unless required for correctness or efficiency
- DO NOT introduce unnecessary abstractions
- DO NOT invent features that do not exist
- DO NOT guess logic: if logic is unclear, mark it clearly
- DO NOT delete features silently
- DO NOT mix layers (no DB logic in handlers, no HTTP logic in services)

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear layered architecture:
  - cmd (entry point)
  - internal/config
  - internal/router
  - internal/handler (HTTP layer only)
  - internal/service (business logic)
  - internal/repository (data access only)
  - internal/model (domain + db models)
  - internal/middleware
  - pkg (shared utilities only)
- One-direction dependency:
  handler → service → repository
- Handlers must be THIN
- Services contain ALL business rules
- Repositories must be storage-agnostic

REFRACTOR PROCESS (STEP BY STEP):
1. Scan the entire vinzhub-rest-api codebase
2. Identify:
   - duplicated logic
   - mixed responsibilities
   - inefficient patterns
   - unclear or dangerous flows
3. Rebuild the project into vinzhub-rest-api-v2 with:
   - clean folder structure
   - consistent naming
   - predictable patterns
4. Move logic into correct layers
5. Normalize request/response handling
6. Centralize:
   - error handling
   - response formatting
   - configuration loading
7. Clearly document any:
   - assumptions
   - fixed bugs
   - refactor decisions

CODE QUALITY RULES:
- Code must be readable without comments
- Functions should do ONE thing
- No magic numbers or hardcoded config
- Consistent naming across the project
- Prefer explicit flow over clever tricks
- Optimize for clarity first, performance second

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- vinzhub-rest-api-v2/
  - clean, structured, production-ready
  - easy to extend for v3+
- Provide:
  - folder structure overview
  - explanation of architectural decisions
  - notes about critical fixes or improvements

IMPORTANT:
This is a REAL refactor, NOT a rewrite fantasy.
Respect existing logic.
Stability > cleverness.
Clean > complex.
